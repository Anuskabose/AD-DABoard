# AD-DABoard
Developing an AD/DA Board using Raspberry Pi
Overview
This repository provides a guide for developing an Analog-to-Digital (AD) / Digital-to-Analog (DA) board using a Raspberry Pi. The board enables interfacing with analog sensors and output devices, making it useful for IoT applications, data acquisition, and signal processing.

Features
Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC): Read analog sensor data.

Digital-to-Analog Conversion (DAC): Output analog signals from digital data.

SPI/I2C Communication: Interface with ADC/DAC chips via Raspberry Pi.

Python API: Easy-to-use Python scripts for data acquisition and signal generation.

Graphical Representation: Data visualization using Matplotlib.

Hardware Requirements
Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO support)

ADC Chip (e.g., MCP3008, ADS1115)

DAC Chip (e.g., MCP4725)

Breadboard & Jumper Wires

Sensors (e.g., temperature, light, potentiometer)

Resistors & Capacitors (as needed)

Software Requirements
OS: Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian)

Python Libraries:

spidev (for SPI communication)

smbus2 (for I2C communication)

RPi.GPIO (for GPIO control)

matplotlib (for visualization)

numpy (for data processing)
